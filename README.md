## Use Case
It is a SUPER bare bones theme intended ONLY to be used to give some extra functionality to our WordPress REST API waypoint and setup a few defaults and helpers along the way. This theme was built as a dev helper and not as a user-face or standard WordPress theme.  It is intended to be used along side my [Project Acorn SSR](https://github.com/jomurgel/project-acorn-ssr) or any SPA which utilizes the WordPress REST API.

## Getting Started
``` bash
$ npm install
```

``` bash
# Compile all the things
$ gulp

# Compile SVG icons
$ gulp icons

# Lints SCSS
$ gulp lint

# Minify and Optimize Admin Styles
$ gulp theme

# Compils Theme styles
$ gulp styles

# Use Browsersync and watch Styles
$ gulp watch
```

## Documentation
### Splash Page
This theme provides a splash page which is present if anyone lands on the homepage that isn't logged in or the options to redirect users to the admin login page.

Access via `Settings` > `Acorn Theme`

### Custom Endpoints
I've added a few custom menu endpoints for easy access to the WordPress menus and featured images. Typically this would be wrapped into a plugin, but it was important to me that we have one item install that was ready to go.

### Featured Image
- Bakes featured image data into the REST API. forked from [BraadMartin](https://github.com/BraadMartin/better-rest-api-featured-images) with a few updates. The featured image sizes are available in the `featured_image` object inside post/page arrays.

For example:

``` json
"featured_image": {
	"id": 23,
	"alt": "",
	"caption": "",
	"description": "",
	"media_type": "image",
	"media": {
	"width": 5472,
	"height": 3648,
	"file": "2017/07/285038.jpg",
	"sizes": {
		"thumbnail": {
		"file": "285038-150x150.jpg",
		"width": 150,
		"height": 150,
		"mime-type": "image/jpeg",
		"source_url": "https://wordpress.test/server/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/285038-150x150.jpg"
		},
	},
	"image_meta": {
		"aperture": "0",
		"credit": "",
		"camera": "",
		"caption": "",
		"created_timestamp": "0",
		"copyright": "",
		"focal_length": "0",
		"iso": "0",
		"shutter_speed": "0",
		"title": "",
		"orientation": "0",
		"keywords": [

		]
	}
}
```

### Menus
It's a miss that the WordPress REST API isn't available by default. I've added a custom endpoint to fix this in `inc/menu-endpoints.php`.
- Can use `/wp-api-menus/v2/menus` for an array of menu slugs, ids and items.
- Can use `/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/id` or `wp-api-menus/v2/menus/slug` to get individual menus data.

### Default Setup
- Adds theme support for `post_thumbnail`.
- Registers WordPress menu: `Main Menu`.
- gulpfile.js with style compiling + svg icon compiling + [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/).
- custom acorn color scheme â€” set by default.
- Forces the standard `/%postname%/` permalink structure out of the box.

### Styles
- Style Reset with [sanitize.scss](https://jonathantneal.github.io/sanitize.css/).
- Base styles with [skeleton.scss](http://getskeleton.com/).

### Extras
This theme removes the customizer functionality, because who needs it, I mean, really? The code was forked and updated from [Customizer Remove All Parts](https://github.com/parallelus/customizer-remove-all-parts).

Acorn provides bare-bones output of page/post previews + some helper notes for those. It is not intended to function as a user-facing theme, but we must be able to preview content since the WordPress Editor is not fantastic about prepresenting the final output.

When logged in the index provides at-a-glance output of the REST API and out custom endpoints above.
